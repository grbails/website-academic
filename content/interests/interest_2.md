I'm also interested in articulatory phonetics, and in particular the mapping between acoustics and articulation. I am currently involved in an ongoing research project (alongside [Stephen Nichols](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/postgrad/stephen.nichols/)) using ultrasound tongue imaging and electromagnetic articulography to investigate /s/-retraction in British English, which explores how different articulatory mechanisms are used to hit similar acoustic targets. Read about it [here](../slides/2018_BAAP_poster.pdf) and [here](../slides/2018_lagb_slides.pdf)!
