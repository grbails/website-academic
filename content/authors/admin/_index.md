I'm a lecturer in phonetics and phonology at the University of York, in the [Department of Language and Linguistic Science](https://www.york.ac.uk/language/). My research lies at the intersection between variationist linguistics, sociophonetics, phonological theory and language change, with a particular interest in northern dialects of British English.

My doctoral research took place at the University of Manchester, where I was funded by the [Economic and Social Research Council](http://www.esrc.ac.uk/). I submitted my thesis, 'Variation and change in Northern English velar nasals: Production and perception', in October of 2018. In this work I pursue a number of research questions regarding the synchronic and diachronic behaviour of /ŋg/ clusters in the North of England and how their variability is represented in speakers' grammars, which speaks to a number of theoretical issues relating to pathways of sound change and the architecture of grammar.
