title: 'Dialect maps'

I run the **Our Dialects** site, which includes over **30 interactive dialect maps** plotting the incredible regional diversity in English dialects of the UK. The project began in 2014 alongside [Laurel MacKenzie](http://www.laurelmackenzie.com/) and [Danielle Turton](https://danielleturton.rbind.io/) and still gets updated each year with new data. It features: 

- dialect questionnaire data from over 8,000 respondents
- respondents ranging in age from 10 to 89, and spanning a geographical region from Lewis to Cornwall
- lexical, phonological, and syntactic variables (what do you call a bread roll? do the words fur and bear rhyme for you? can you say *give it me*?)
