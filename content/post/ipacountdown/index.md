title: 'IPA countdown'
---

IPA countdown is a game I developed using [Shiny R](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), essentially replicating [the famous British TV show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)) in which contestants have to form words from a set of randomly selected letters. The key difference? In IPA countdown, you're using IPA symbols to put together phonemic transcriptions rather than orthographic representations. I think this is a really good resource for students, particularly undergraduates who are learning the IPA chart for the first time in introductory phonetics classes.
