title: 'Working with Twitter data in R'
---

In 2019 I delivered a workshop on **working with Twitter data in R** at Queen's University, Belfast, as part of the interdisciplinary _New Methods for New Media_ summer school. The tutorial covers:

- how to collect Twitter data and search for tweets by content, user, and location
- how to analyse patterns of word use on Twitter, including ngrams and ngram networks
- how to work with geolocation data and visualise regional variation with static and interactive maps
- how to perform basic sentiment analysis (e.g. to compare the evaluation of topics discussed on Twitter)
