title: 'Working with sociophonetic data in R'
---

In 2019 I delivered a workshop on **using R to analyse sociophonetic data** at the University of Sheffield. The tutorial, which focuses specifically on static and dynamic formant analysis, covers the following:

- data wrangling using the *tidyverse* (i.e. how to add, remove and re-code columns, and reshape data when working with formant trajectories)
- how to perform basic descriptive statistics for exploratory analysis of vowel formant data
- how to plot vowel formant data, including dynamic formant trajectories
